## Format

All documentation should be made available in open formats.
Preference is:

* For images: JEPG or PNG.
* For drawings, maps, and labels: SVG.
* For text documentation: ODT ([OpenDocument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument)) for editable format and PDF for print-ready format.

Recommended software is
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for SVG and
[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) or
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for text documents.
If you export from proprietary software, please ensure that these open-source software can properly open your files.

For material designed to be printed, it is recommended to provide both the source material (e.g. SVG, ODT)
as well as a PDF ready to print.
